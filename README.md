Please see all the files uploaded from the Bootstrap-Phantom template and start editing. Please download these Bootstrap files in your pc as well. The folders Dark and Light contains relevant files however, we won't be needing much of them. Its just you can find the file name as Index.html and main.css in the CSS folder. Whatever changes you make, just make in these files only. For changing CSS, it is advised to make your own css file then adding it onto the index.html and make changes instead of editing the main.css . The only thing we need to change is the CSS and HTML, editing of Javascript related things can be done at the last or simultaneously if needed.
